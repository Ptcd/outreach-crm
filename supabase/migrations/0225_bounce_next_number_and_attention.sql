-- 0225: a card whose number bounced tries its next number, and Muse's offer steps show where she already looks.
--
-- 1. The bounce gap (Colin 2026-11-13: "those automatically are getting marked as such on the cards right?"). They
--    are: a first text that comes back from the carrier as a dead number marks that phone bad. But the card then sat
--    at "first text sent" for good. The laptop's old plan retried the owner on their next mobile at once
--    (wpie.campaign.select.replan_eligible); that rule was lost when the server took over the day's list (0219),
--    whose "next number" rows only covered a card someone had answered "wrong number" on. In three weeks 192 cards
--    with another usable number were left that way. The pool now lists them as next numbers too. Every other check
--    is next_phone_problem's, unchanged: never a phone that already had its text, never while an earlier text may
--    have arrived, never once anyone on a good phone answered or was reached.
--    (A card with no other number goes on phones_wanted from the laptop: wpie.live.phones_wanted, phone_bad.)
--
-- 2. agent_attention(): what is waiting on the agent that it has not looked at: offer steps that are hers, and desk
--    posts since she last read the desk. The door adds it to sending_status and text_results, which she reads every
--    few minutes, because on 2026-11-13 the desk went unread from 3:36 PM while three offers ran late.
